# 🧠 KING JU | AI Hacker | Repo Remixer | Human++ Coder

Welcome to the lab.

This isn’t your typical code dump.  
This is where open-source gets **remixed, refactored, and redefined**.  
I'm here to **bend AI** until it breaks — then rebuild it better.  
Not just automation. Not just orchestration.  
**I'm evolving code into cognition.**

---

## 💡 What I Do

- 🧬 Build Modular AI Systems that self-config, self-heal, and self-scale.
- 🧠 Create MCP Servers that turn boring GitHub repos into autonomous tools.
- 🔐 Blend Recon, PenTesting, and Vision AI for unstoppable agents.
- 🔄 Remix existing projects like a digital chemist on a synth trip.

## ⚔️ Philosophy

> *I don’t fork repos. I weaponize them.*

This is **post-DevOps**.
This is **post-Prompt Engineering**.
This is **AI infrastructure for the next era**.

---

## 🎛️ The Stack

- 🐳 Docker everything — isolation is power.
- 🧠 Ollama, GPT-4, LLaMA3 — local when needed, cloud when necessary.
- 📦 Supabase, Redis, Qdrant, Neo4j — structured chaos.
- ⚡ Caddy, ZeroTier, reverse proxy sorcery.

## 📡 Why This Exists

To push boundaries.  
To make AI tools so lean, mean, and **commercially dangerous** —  
others won’t just copy...  
**They’ll try to reverse-engineer the echo.**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Some of what you’ll see here will look like magic.  
That’s because it is.  
But don’t ask for the spellbook.
